# Sleep Wear API demo
nodejs code loosely based on: https://github.com/jeremiahlee/fitbit-twilio-demo

## Overview
Automate tasks particular to the individual such as:

power consumption limiting. exercise recommendations. sleep mode.

Will be using my FitBit to calculate the datapoints and potentially an Arduino to depict the connection between sleep and the physical environment.

Fitbit trackers sync every 15â€“20 minutes when near a Fitbit USB dongle or [supported smart phone](https://www.fitbit.com/devices). Users can also manually request a Fitbit tracker sync.
